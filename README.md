# Anime_Character_Classifier
WARNING: STILL UNDER CONSTRUCT

This project is just an NN experiment about classifying anime characters.

To start with, you have to create a folder (at the path of main.py) and put video into it.
Then you can:
* Use ```python main.py saveframe foldername ``` to Save Frame
* Use ```python main.py detectface foldername``` to Detect Character Face
* Use ```python main.py manclassify foldername``` to Classify Training Data
